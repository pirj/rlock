# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** AI agents can run in full "danger mode" without risking the host machine -- code stays isolated, secrets stay on the host, and the only bridge is git.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — cli-skeleton-and-vm-lifecycle

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (cli-skeleton-and-vm-lifecycle) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

-

- [Phase 01]: Source ui.sh before util.sh so die() has access to color variables
- [Phase 01]: Use ShellCheck --severity=warning for CI (SC1091 info on dynamic source is expected)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Codex CLI on Alpine/musl: No confirmation that Codex binary has a musl-compatible build. May need glibc compat layer or npm install. Test early in Phase 3.
- Claude Code on Alpine: Requires libgcc, libstdc++, ripgrep. Needs hands-on testing for full dependency chain.
- Caddy remote_ip matcher with QEMU SLIRP: Source IP matching needs validation with actual SLIRP traffic in Phase 2.
